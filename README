This plugin will download and run any remote snippets and plugins found in your vimrc.

Use in a similar fashion as the built-in source command:

Source git://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim.git
Source git://gist.github.com/1229444.git
Source https://raw.github.com/gist/1229444/6d07d825fa99a26d2dcc0fd83e9a8b1c78978bfa/statusline-help.vim

If sourcing a repository on Github, you can source the project page instead:

Source https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim
Source https://gist.github.com/1229444

If installing a plugin requires a few commands, add them after the repository:

Source git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git rake make

Automatic updates occur once a week when starting Vim. This will git pull any repositories and re-download any other files. You can force an update calling the Source command with a bang:

Source! https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim

REQUIREMENTS

Several system commands are called: echo, cat, cd, mkdir, rm, mv, date. Also, if sourcing a git repository, the git command is used. And if sourcing a regular text, the curl command is used.

I've only tested this with OS X 10.7 and Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS.
